## User demographics of Online Shoppers
The characteristics of frequent shoppers may surprise you especially when you know how much they have changed over a short period of time. We will now take a look at their age, gender and in-market segments. To do this, the data below has been analysed using indexing (each data set shows how the frequent online shoppers differ from the overall population).
## Hosted shopping carts: 
A third-party firm "hosts" the solution and is responsible for server backups, maintenance and upgrades. The beauty of a hosted solution is that hosting comes free, which means it doesn't cost anything for the third party to keep your site functional on the Web. The main drawback with hosted solutions is that customers will be directed to another domain for payment processing.
